I have used created this project as per instructed in [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pVyXOaXpMM1WSxexL2JRCHHzylTOwoIYT7rgV57MkSY/edit)

I have used [Dummy Json](https://dummyjson.com/docs) for dummy:

- Authentication
- Getting todo task

**NOTE**

- I have used random function to determine isToday/isTomorrow todo task as this api doesn't return that value
- Similarly, I have created Random time of day as I was not getting it through api
